Seton Fund – a Nonprofit Organization Providing Financial Resources for Families Seeking Traditional Education - Business Plan 

Executive Summary
Our nonprofit, Seton Fund, is dedicated to supporting families with financial assistance to ensure access to a traditional education for their children. With a focus on primary, secondary, and higher education, our foundation aims to financial aid tools to alleviate the burden of tuition costs for families who desire a traditional education experience for their children. By addressing barriers to educational access, we will work to foster a future where all children, regardless of economic status, have the opportunity to succeed in a traditional educational environment.

Mission Statement
Seton Fund's mission is to ensure that every child, regardless of financial background, has access to a traditional education that supports their academic, social, and personal growth. Through financial support, educational resources, and community partnerships, we aim to empower families to give their children the opportunity to thrive in a traditional academic setting.

Vision Statement
Our vision is to create a world where traditional education is not a privilege, but a universal right. We envision a future where every child has the support they need to pursue their educational goals, attend a school of their choice, and reach their full potential in life - while encouraging their personal networks and communities to participate in supporting them.

Objectives
1. Provide Financial Support: Offer tuition assistance to families to cover tuition, fees, educational materials, and ancillary school-related activities.
2. Educational Advocacy: Advocate for traditional education models and promote access to quality schooling, regardless of financial status.
3. Community Engagement: Build a network of supporters, including individuals, corporations, and educational institutions, to create a sustainable resource pool for funding.
4. Empower Families: Provide resources to help families understand the application and admissions process for their desired school, provide a financial tool that allows families to crowd-source contributions on their own, and sets their child up with access to a traditional education with financial independence.


Target Market
Seton Fund will target all families who are seeking traditional education for their children. Our primary beneficiaries will include:
* Anyone: any child looking to afford traditional education.
* Madison-area: Families in and around the greater Madison, WI area

Programs and Services
1. Tuition Payment: Seton Fund will establish a 529 for each student seeking financial help to attend private schools. Funds distributed to each student’s individual 529 can be applied to tuition, school supplies, uniforms, extracurricular activities, and other educational costs.
2. Application and Enrollment Assistance: For families looking for assistance with application and enrollment processes, we will provide as much guidance as possible.
3. Financial Vehicle Setup: For each student, Seton Fund will set up a 529 that will serve as the student’s account for all tuition and school-related expenses.  The Fund will then deposit as close to 100% of the cost of their annual education expenses as possible to facilitate the payment of tuition and such expenses.  
4. Community Participation: Seton Fund will offer access to workshops for parents to better understand financial planning for education; will educate parents on how to use the 529 to garner further support from their individual communities; and understanding how to maximize the value of traditional education.

Market Analysis
* Education Funding Needs: A significant percentage of families in the United States face financial barriers to accessing traditional education. National studies indicate that the cost of tuition for private schools are unaffordable for many families.
* Social Impact: Access to education is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty. Studies show that children from low-income families who have access to quality education are more likely to pursue higher education and succeed in the workforce.






Revenue Generation Strategy
1. Donations and Sponsorships: The nonprofit will actively seek donations from individuals, corporate partners, and philanthropic foundations. These contributions will be used to fund  educational programs and overhead.
2. Fundraising Events: Annual fundraising events, such as golf tournaments, will help raise additional funds for the foundation.
3. Partnerships with Educational Institutions: At the end of each fiscal year we will donate funds to the schools (or organizations associated with the schools) that our applicants attend in proportion to the number of students at each.
4. Corporate Sponsorships: Collaborating with companies to sponsor scholarships or educational programs in exchange for recognition and tax benefits.

Marketing Strategy
1. Website: A user-friendly website will provide information on how to apply, donate, and stay updated on the fund’s initiatives. 
2. Community Outreach: Build relationships with local community leaders, schools, and religious organizations to spread awareness about the financial resources available and how to apply.
3. Word of Mouth: Referrals within each of the school communities will be a major source of marketing.

Operational Plan
1. Staffing: The foundation will hire a small team including an Executive Director and a Program Manager.  We will look to add a dedicated role for a Fundraising Coordinator, and will likely contract Financial Advisor services as needed.
2. Board of Directors: A dedicated Board of Directors will provide governance and strategic guidance.
3. Volunteers: A network of volunteers will help with event planning, administrative support, and community outreach.
4. Location: Initially based in Madison, WI with plans to expand further as funding grows.
